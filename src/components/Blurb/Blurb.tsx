      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p className="contentArea">
        My passion is creative technologies and bridging the gap between the
        development and design worlds. I spend my free time working on passion
        projects, mostly involving personal front-end projects, hobbyist
        electronics, Arduino programming and creating installation art pieces.
        <br />I have spent the past few years working in front-end development
        and I possess solid knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js and
        Bootstrap and more, with an ability to quickly learn new technologies. I
        have demonstrated success in identifying and resolving complex code
        issues.
