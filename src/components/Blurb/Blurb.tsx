      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a junior front-end developer and creative technologist based in
        TƒÅmaki Makaurau/Auckland, New Zealand. I employ a multi-disciplinary
        approach to my work and learning, possessing a large range of skills
        obtained through my formal education, work experience and my freelance
        work. I work freelance as an independent installation artist, primarily
        using my skills in microcontroller programming and lighting. I also
        studied game design, and have created several small digital games, which
        can be viewed on my <a href="https://liam-coll.itch.io/">itch.io</a>{" "}
        page.
